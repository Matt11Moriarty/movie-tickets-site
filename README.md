## [Description](#table-of-contents)

As owners of a boutique classic cinema, we wanted an in-house ticketing software that allows us to deliver hand picked films, and provide a seamless booking experience for our customers. In order to make this dream a reality, we teamed up to build a custom application. Once a user creates a profile, they will have access to the full application and select as many seats as desired for themselves, and any friends and family they want!
After seat selection, they will be presented with their personalized QRCode, which contains all of their ticket information.
In building this project, we learned how to build a scalable web-app using the MVC framework, and manage content and users in both the front and back end.
